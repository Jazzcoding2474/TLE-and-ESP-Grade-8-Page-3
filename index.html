<p>
1. Have you ever experienced not forgiving someone asking for
your forgiveness? Why? </p>
    <p>Ans: I have, they were annoying and I just couldn't bare with the fact that I needed to forgive them for what they did and decided not to forgive them.</p>

<p>2. How does it affects you when you reject someone asking for
    your forgiveness?</p>
    <p>Ans: I feel a sense of guilt, while they tried to muster up the courage to ask for forgiveness, here I am rejecting it, due to my spite. </p>

<p> 3. How about when someone is rejecting you when you ask for
    their forgiveness? </p>
    <p>Ans: I would be a bit irrational and go for revenge, while this isn't the way I should act, I spent all this time hurting my pride by saying that "I'm sorry, I was wrong, can you forgive me for my actions?" Only for them to reject it.</p>

    <p>4. Why is it important for you to forgive someone?</p>
    <p>Ans: "..., should this even be asked? Like I said before, they mustered up their courage to go ahead and you that they were wrong and are asking for forgiveness, so just accept it!" </p>

    <p>5. What advice can you tell to all the people having a hard time
        forgiving someone?</p>
    <p>Ans: Go for it, you may hurt your pride but "Who cares?!" just as long as you are fine with hurting your pride a bit then go for it!</p>
